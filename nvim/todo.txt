1. Auto-format on file save (something like conform.nvim)?
2. Snippet engine (like LuaSnip)?
3. Add workspace-diagnostics.nvim / trouble.nvim error + warning count to lualine
4. Make signcolumn permanent - focus.nvim fucks something up.
    - When there are warnings/errors, signcolumn comes up, but when you switch to insert mode and they disappear, the signcolumn also disappears causing annoying movement of the code sideways.
